# Microprocessor Simulator
Model of a microprocessor software simulator with a friendly interface. The program carries out the three orders of <code>MOV</code> - send, <code>ADD</code> - add and <code>SUB</code> - subtract. The processor has four general-purpose 16-bit registers (A, B, C, D). Button <code>"save in file"</code> enables the user to save contents from the "ORDERS" field to a <code>.txt</code> file. The program allows you to write short programs using the available commands and addressing modes. The program enables the execution of written programs in the overall execution mode and the step-by-step mode.

# Testing
Make sure that <code>.txt</code> file path in <code>Program.cs</code> is correct
